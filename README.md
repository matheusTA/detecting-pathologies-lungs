# 🦠 Detecting pathologies lungs

> Due to the pandemic brought by the new coronavirus, COVID-19, the search for rapid identification and control of the disease has become a critical issue in health care worldwide. The methods of diagnosis have been developed little by little, and although it is a complement for identification, the use of lungs radiographs has been adopted. In addition, a group of lung diseases can also be identified from radiographs, these are pneumonia and tuberculosis. Image processing is a topic already well studied in the artificial intelligence literature and, more specifically, in the computer vision area. In this work the main object of study is to use convolutional neural network architecture to assist in the classification and possible detection of this group of diseases observable by X-rays. The research was conducted by analyzing three neural models and comparing their results by applying changes in the architecture and deep learning techniques.
